Study found a significant difference in desipramine and imipramine/desipramine concentration per dose unit between the six defined SGD groups: SGD 0 (combination of no function alleles), SGD 0.5 (combination of no function and decreased function allele), SGD 1 (combination of two decreased function alleles or one normal function and one no function allele), SGD 1.5 (combination of a normal function with a decreased function allele), SGD 2 (two normal function alleles) and SGD >2 (more than 2 functional alleles) p< 0.0001.
