peginterferon alfa-2a,Efficacy,P value  0.01,European,25393304,"Patients were analyzed by HCV genotype (1,2,3,4). Patients with HCV genotype 1 were divided into groups receiving dual therapy (GT1 (d); peg-intron alpha 2a/b, ribavirn) or triple therapy (GT1 (t); peg-intron alpha 2a/b, ribavirn, telaprevir). Sustained virological response (SVR) is a measure of therapeutic efficacy. Variables that were significant in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. The authors designated three ""beneficial"" genotypes that were found at higher frequencies in patients who achieved SVR: rs12979860 CC, rs8099917 TT, rs368234815 TT/TT. These genotypes were often found together. 98% of patients with GT1 (d), 100% of patients with GT1(t), 96% of patients with HCV genotype 2, 92% of patients with HCV genotype 3 and 98% of patients with HCV genotype 4 had those genotype combinations. rs8099917 TT was the strongest predictor of SVR in GT1(t) patients (p=0.026) and was strongly correlated with SVR in patients infected with HCV genotype 4 (P<0.001). In univariate analysis, the TT genotype was a significant predictor of SVR in GT1(d) (p<0.01) and GT1(t) (p=0.02). The TT genotype was found to be significant in a multivariate analysis of predictive factors of SVR within all HCV genotype 1 infected patients. The CC genotype was also associated with higher HCV RNA concentration at baseline in patients with HCV genotype 3 (p=0.005), 2/3 (p=0.017) and GT1(d) (p<0.001) as well as increased ALT levels in HCV genotype 2/3 (p=0.077).","Genotype TT is associated with increased response to peginterferon alfa-2a, peginterferon alfa-2b, ribavirin or telaprevir in people with Hepatitis C, Chronic as compared to genotypes GG + GT.",rs8099917,research
